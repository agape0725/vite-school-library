        The much-awaited Basketball Intramurals have finally begun, bringing
        excitement and energy to our school! Students, teachers, and staff
        gathered to witness the opening ceremony, setting the stage for an
        intense yet friendly competition. The first match showcased incredible
        teamwork, passion, and determination, with players giving their all on
        the court. <br />

        Cheers and applause echoed throughout the gym as every shot, pass, and
        steal kept the crowd on the edge of their seats. Beyond the competition,
        this event is about sportsmanship, camaraderie, and school spirit. As
        the games continue, we look forward to more thrilling moments,
        unforgettable plays, and the bonds that make our intramurals more than
